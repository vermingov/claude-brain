// The only place in the brain that fetches something the user typed.
//
// A design capture takes a URL from a text box and asks the server to go get it, which is
// the textbook shape of an SSRF: the request comes from inside the machine, so it reaches
// whatever the machine can reach — the cloud metadata endpoint, a router admin page, a
// service bound to loopback that assumed nothing local was hostile. Everything here exists
// to make "go fetch this" mean "go fetch something on the public internet, and nothing
// else, no matter how the address is dressed up".
//
// The parts that are easy to get subtly wrong, and why they are written the way they are:
//
//   - Resolution is checked for EVERY address a name returns, not the first. A name that
//     answers with one public address and one private address is a deliberate attack, and
//     a guard that reads addrs[0] waves it through half the time.
//   - IPv6 has three ways to spell an IPv4 address (::ffff: mapped, NAT64, 6to4). Each is
//     unwrapped and the embedded v4 re-checked, or 64:ff9b::7f00:1 walks straight past a
//     v6-only deny-list to 127.0.0.1.
//   - Redirects are walked by hand with the full gate re-run per hop. `redirect: "follow"`
//     resolves later hops inside fetch where no check can see them, which turns any open
//     redirector into a bypass.
//   - Byte caps count DECOMPRESSED bytes. Bun inflates transparently, so Content-Length
//     describes the compressed stream and a 2 MB cap on it happily accepts a 2 GB bomb.
//
// Deliberately NOT solved here, and stated plainly because a guard is worse than useless if
// its own comments overclaim: DNS rebinding between the gate and the connect. resolveAndGate
// vets every address a name returns, then `fetch` resolves the name again itself, so a
// record that changes in between is not caught. Closing it needs the socket pinned to an
// address already checked — connecting to the literal and carrying the original Host and TLS
// server name — which is a change to how every request here is issued, not a flag. Until
// then the exposure is bounded by everything else on this page: a rebind still has to land
// on a host willing to answer, and the response is only ever read as text or image bytes.
