//
// Three jobs, in the order the brain does them:
//  1. encode  — mine any session log not yet in the episodic store
//  2. abstract — find traces that recurred across separate sessions; a thing that keeps
//                happening is a fact about the world, not an incident, and belongs in
//                the vault as a note
//  3. forget  — drop weak, never-rehearsed traces so retrieval stays fast
//
// Step 2 only *proposes*. Writing to the vault stays a deliberate act, because the
// vault is the user's and a wrong auto-note would poison every later recall.
