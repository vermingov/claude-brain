// Turning a vision model's JSON into the thing that is actually retrievable: a note.
//
// The brain's retrieval is text — BM25 over FTS5 plus 384-dim embeddings — so an image
// blob is not memory, it is an attachment. What makes "build me something like that
// dashboard I saved" work is a durable written description sitting in the vault next to
// everything else the user knows, indexed by the same indexer, editable in Obsidian,
// carried by the same rclone sync.
//
// The image that goes with it is a preview, never the upload. The vault is usually a synced
// folder, so anything written here is something the user uploads to Dropbox or Mega; the
// real bytes stay in DATA_DIR (design-store.ts) and only a small downscaled copy travels.
//
// Nothing here spawns a subprocess, so session-memory.ts and the CLI can import the brief
// renderer without dragging in the LLM bridge.
