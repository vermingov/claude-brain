// The background pass that turns a stored image into a description the brain can recall.
//
// Two properties this file exists to guarantee:
//
//  1. An upload returns immediately. A vision call takes tens of seconds and costs money;
//     making the user wait on it would make dropping twelve screenshots feel broken.
//  2. The queue survives a restart. Every retry deadline lives in `designs.next_attempt_at`
//     rather than only in a live timer, and `extracting` is a lease another process may
//     reclaim once it has expired — without that, a restart two minutes into a batch
//     strands one row mid-flight and the rest queued forever, with a dashboard polling a
//     state that never terminates. One unref'd wake timer reads those deadlines back, so a
//     row that says "this retries shortly" is telling the truth.
//
// When the `claude` CLI is absent, or LLM features are off, nothing here fails silently:
// the image is still stored and listed, the row carries the honest reason, and turning the
// feature on later drains the backlog.

 * `reorganize --apply` files notes into folders of its own choosing and does not treat the
 * design folder as frozen, so "not at its recorded path" is far more often "moved" than
 * "deleted". Getting that wrong is not a cosmetic error: the dashboard offers to restore a
 * note that is flagged missing, and restoring one that still exists elsewhere leaves the
 * user with two copies of a note they may have edited, both of which recall then ranks.
 *
 * The match must be unambiguous — same filename *and* the `brain-design:` stamp the note
 * writer puts in its own frontmatter. Anything less certain is left flagged.
